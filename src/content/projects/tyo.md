TYO Mag is an online arts and literary magazine featuring artwork from Japanese artists and foreign artists working in Japan. As conceived by myself and my [co-founder](http://krishartrum.com), TYO is meant to help connect those creating art in Tokyo and Japan to the outside art world (especially the non-Japanese speaking art world).

# About

My background is in literature—I have a Masters in poetry and creative writing from Temple University—and I've spent the last few years teaching writing and literature in Universities and High Schools in the US and Japan. I've become very passionate about creating on the web and crafting web sites because I'm interested in making great art and literature more accessible by improving the way we see new and existing content.

Often artists and writers, due to art's sometimes esoteric nature, can miss out on the benefits of new technology, and the growing best practices of mobile presentation isn't applied to the work of our society's most exciting creators. I believe that accessibility breeds better appreciation, and I've sought to increase the exposure of the arts by improving the presentation. Mobile access is very important to me, and I always start crafting and architecting the mobile experience first.

My design philosophies tend to begin with text and type due to my background studying literature, but my user experiences philosophies are distilled from my experiences teaching. Students, especially older students, aren't willing to admit what they don't know. As a teacher, it's hard to determine what a student knows, and it's best to never take for granted what you think they should or do know. 

My tasks are to help a user recognize patterns and give them enough information to fill in any gaps and reaffirm what they already know. However, my main task is to observe, ask questions, and take feedback—to swallow my ego and remain flexible. Design and teaching are iterative processes.

    "about": "<p>My TYO co-editor, Kris Hartrum, was in need of a new site to showcase his writing. His previous site was a Wordpress blog, and he needed something that would easily allow potential freelance clients to see some of his more serious work. It is a static site generated with Jekyll.</p>"

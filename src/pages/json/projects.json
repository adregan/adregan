    "about": "<p>TYO Mag is an online arts and literary magazine featuring artwork from Japanese artists and foreign artists working in Japan. As my <a href='http://krishartrum.com'>co-editor</a> and I originally conceived TYO, it is meant to help connect those creating art in Tokyo to the outside art world (especially the non-Japanese speaking art world).</p><p>In developing the site, I placed a premium on readability across all devices. A very significant portion of our audience finds TYO through social media, and often, that's on their phones. So all of the issues are fully responsive.</p>"

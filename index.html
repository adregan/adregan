As my <a href="http://krishartrum.com">co-editor</a> and I originally conceived TYO, it is meant to help connect those creating art in Tokyo to the outside art world (especially the non-Japanese speaking art world).</p><p>In developing the site, I placed a premium on readability across all devices. A very significant portion of our audience finds TYO through social media, and often, that's on their phones. So all of the issues are fully responsive.</p></div></div></article><article class="project tender"><div class="wrapped"><img src="resources/tender.png" alt=""><div><p class="about"></p><p>A painter friend, Sadie Starnes, was looking for a new project to kill some time in between art shows.

His previous site was a Wordpress blog, and he needed something that would easily allow potential freelance clients to see some of his more serious work. Because his site updates so infrequently, I went with a static site and blog generated with Jekyll. The site is fully responsive.</p></div></div></article></section><section id="about" class="wrapped"><h2>About AD Regan</h2><article><p>My background is in literature—I have a Masters in poetry and creative writing from Temple University.

A well architected website, especially for mobile devices, shares a lot of similarities with a well crafted essay, story, or poem, and I tend to think out projects as text first.</p><p>I've spent the past few years teaching in Universities and High Schools in America and Japan, and working with students has informed a lot of my thoughts on user experience design. I've found that you should never take for granted what a student or a user knows, and by taking a moment to explain something—even if you think it might be obvious—you can help a user avoid feeling left behind.</p><p>My passion for the past few years has been to spread art and literature from Japan to the world through the project <em>TYO Mag</em>. My goal has been to improve the presentation and delivery of the work, which is less lucrative and often ignored by new technologies, so that someone could chose to look at art over playing a game on their commute. As such, mobile accessibility and responsive design became the cornerstone of my web philosophies.</p><p>I'm hoping to work with a team that's inherently creative and trying to make sure that the cultural side of the web gets as much attention as ...</p></article></section><div class="contact"><a href="mailto:duncanregan@gmail.com"><span class="button-text">Drop me a line</span></a></div></body></html>

As conceived by myself and my <a href="http://krishartrum.com">co-founder</a>, TYO is meant to help connect those creating art in Tokyo and Japan to the outside art world (especially the non-Japanese speaking art world).</p></div><div class="info-link"><div class="ex-button"></div><span>info</span></div></article><article class="project khartrum"><a href="http://krishartrum.com"><img src="resources/khartrum.png" alt=""></a><div class="details wrapped"><p>My TYO co-founder, Kris Hartrum, was in need of a new site to showcase his writing.

I've become very passionate about creating on the web and crafting web sites because I'm interested in making great art and literature more accessible by improving the way we see new and existing content.</p><p>Often artists and writers, due to art's sometimes esoteric nature, can miss out on the benefits of new technology, and the growing best practices of mobile presentation isn't applied to the work of our society's most exciting creators. I believe that accessibility breeds better appreciation, and I've sought to increase the exposure of the arts by improving the presentation. Mobile access is very important to me, and I always start crafting and architecting the mobile experience first.</p><p>My design philosophies tend to begin with text and type due to my background studying literature, but my user experiences philosophies are distilled from my experiences teaching. Students, especially older students, aren't willing to admit what they don't know. As a teacher, it's hard to determine what a student knows, and it's best to never take for granted what you think they should or do know.</p><p>My tasks are to help a user recognize patterns and give them enough information to fill in any gaps and reaffirm what they already know. However, my main task is to observe, ask questions, and take feedback—to swallow my ego and remain flexible. Design and teaching are iterative processes.</p></article></section><section class="contact"><div class="wrapped"><p>If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to <a href="mailto:duncanregan@gmail.com">drop me a line</a> or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/adregan">twitter</a>.</p></div></section><script type="text/javascript" src="js/ADRegan.min.js"></script></body></html>

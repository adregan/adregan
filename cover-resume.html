    <p>My name is Duncan Regan, and I work in front-end design and development. I have recently returned to America after three years living in Tokyo, and I'm currently staying in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.</p>
    <p>I have a Masters in poetry from Temple University, and my background is in literature. But, over the past few years I have been running an online art and lit magazine called TYO (http://tyomag.com) in addition to teaching. With the recent design trends inspired by mobile and responsive design and the burgeoning field of web type, I felt the time was right to jump back into web development—the field leveled.</p>
    <p>Apart from responsive design, I am also currently obsessed with static site generators and have been playing with Jekyll for blogs and Assemble for everything else. I work in Sass and have switched to autoprefixer from Compass, and I try to organize my styles according to the SMACSS workflow. I concat, uglify, minify, etc. with Grunt. Version control with Git.</p>
    <p>My basic workflow: I architect a site's structure on paper first and then wireframe as text outlines. I build a site completely unstyled (usually with Normalize in place), and after I set the type and adjust the measure. Then I block out the design in a graphics program (I'm using Sketch these days), and I refine the design in devtools and my text editor, creating assets as I go. And I always start from mobile and move my way up.</p>
    <p>I'm really excited to be back in the States, and I hope to work alongside some creative and expressive individuals. I am passionate about wanting to shape the way people interact with great content over the years to come, and I consider the web to be a growing artistic medium.</p>

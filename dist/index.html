As my <a href="http://krishartrum.com">co-editor</a> and I originally conceived TYO, it is meant to help connect those creating art in Tokyo to the outside art world (especially the non-Japanese speaking art world).</p><p>In developing the site, I placed a premium on readability across all devices.

I've found that you should never take for granted what a student or a user knows, and by taking a moment to explain something—even if you think it might be obvious—you can help a user avoid feeling left behind.</p><p>My passion for the past few years has been to spread art and literature from Japan to the world through the project <em>TYO Mag</em>. My goal has been to improve the presentation and delivery of the work, which is less lucrative and often ignored by new technologies, so that someone could chose to look at art over playing a game on their commute. As such, mobile accessibility and responsive design became the cornerstone of my web philosophies.</p><p>I'm hoping to work with a team that's inherently creative and trying to make sure that the cultural side of the web gets as much attention as ...</p></article></section></body></html>
